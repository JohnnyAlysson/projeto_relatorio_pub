<h2 id=about> about </h2>    

The goal of this portfolio project is to create a practical program for companies and others to appreciate, showcasing my programming skills.
The project involves a program that analyzes a database, calculates key information, and sends an email with a comprehensive report.
This project stems from my studies in the field of programming and includes my notes and thoughts as I studied and developed the program.

1. Import modules;
2. Read and manipulate the database;
